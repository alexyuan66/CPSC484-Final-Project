how to install any dependencies and run the project (2 pts)
    "how to install any dependencies" refers to code dependencies (e.g., if you have python dependencies)

provides a brief description of the project and what tasks the installation addresses (1 pts)

indicates explicitly if there are any constraints from the deployment environment (0.5 pts)
    the text file should explain any physical constraints that are important to consider when the course staff evaluates the system prototype. For instance, would users need to be able to stand at least a minimum distance away from the Kinect for the application to run as intended?

    "constraints from the deployment environment" refers to constraints in the physical environment that are relevant for your system prototype. For example, your prototype is probably built for a given physical location (given by your specific display). Similarly, your prorotype may depend on specific sensing capabilities (e.g., kinect skeleton tracking, group detection, etc.). Documenting all these constraints is useful in case you ever want to run your project on a different environment.

includes a collaboration record that specifies what each team member contributed to the prototype (1.5 pts)
