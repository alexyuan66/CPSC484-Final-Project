# Project

## Description

Our project aims to create a self-care platform that promotes mental well-being. This is achieved by encouraging users to engage in healthy habits and stress-reducing activities.

To incentivize users, the platform includes a cute mascot, a health bar/point system. Users complete tasks, such as breathing exercises, listening to jokes/inspirational quotes, and completing a self-care checklist. Each time one of these actions is completed, health points are added to the mascot, which can be seen on the health bar under the mascot.

By providing practical mental health solutions that can be done anywhere, the platform aims to produce healthy habits and improve the mental well-being of its users.

## Addressed Tasks

1. To engage the users, a cute creature such as a mascot (e.g. Handsome Dan) should be displayed on the screen to move or jump around as the user approaches the sensor. This could encourage the user to interact with our solution. During the interviews, it was noted that users missed the sources of comfort from their home, such as pets and family members, which could might help enhance their mental well-being.
    - This task is addressed by having a cute pixel-cat GIF that continuously plays on the screen. This virtual pet has a health bar which enhances the user’s engagement with the virtual system.
2. Participants should be able to have some sort of incentive to engage with the platform such as a task bar, health bar, score, etc. We introduced this task because interviewees indicated a desire for an incentive to complete self-care tasks.
    - This is achieved in our project through the inclusion of a health bar which can increase when users perform tasks. This provides a gamification aspect to the self-care tasks, giving users a sense of accomplishment and encouraging them to continue engaging with the platform.
3. Users can ask the mascot to 'cheer them up, in which case the mascot could tell them a funny joke or something. Interviewees mentioned jokes as something that made them happy.
    - This is achieved by having an option in the self-care tasks to hear a funny joke or receive an inspirational quote while the mascot is standing next to the text. This feature provides a source of entertainment and joy for the user, and makes them more appreciative of the mascot.
4. Users can answer a questionnaire about their health. This questionnaire/checklist is to remind users to do good things for their health such as drinking water, exercising, eating, etc. This will help motivate users to complete their self-care tasks, which interviewees indicated a desire towards.
    - This is achieved by having a section in the tasks option to complete a set of “self-care” tasks, which includes actions such as “Drink Water,” “Exercise,” “Remind Yourself You’re Amazing,” and “Talk to a Friend,” which we hope that the user will see as valuable additions to their routines. The rewarding of points for completing these tasks is also included to incentivize users to complete them regularly.
5. Participants should be able to receive guided practice on good deep breathing techniques. Many studies have shown how deep breathing can positively influence mental health and reduce stress. Interviewees also indicated an interest in practical mental health solutions that can be done anywhere, which deep breathing accommodates.
    - This is achieved by having a “controlled breathing” action that the user can perform which provides points to the user. This allows the user to practice and master this important skill while also providing an incentive to continue, perhaps multiple times. We also provide visual and auditory cues to guide the user through the deep breathing exercise to ensure they are following proper technique. The presence of the mascot and provides positive reinforcement during the exercise, making it a more enjoyable and effective experience for the user.

# Usage

TODO

## Physical Constraints

- the text file should explain any physical constraints that are important to consider when the course staff evaluates the system prototype. For instance, would users need to be able to stand at least a minimum distance away from the Kinect for the application to run as intended?
- "constraints from the deployment environment" refers to constraints in the physical environment that are relevant for your system prototype. For example, your prototype is probably built for a given physical location (given by your specific display). Similarly, your prorotype may depend on specific sensing capabilities (e.g., kinect skeleton tracking, group detection, etc.). Documenting all these constraints is useful in case you ever want to run your project on a different environment.

# Installation

- how to install any dependencies and run the project (2 pts). "how to install any dependencies" refers to code dependencies (e.g., if you have python dependencies)
- indicates explicitly if there are any constraints from the deployment environment (0.5 pts)

    - I helped write up the README for the document, specifically the Project section including a description and tasks.
    - I created the framework for the website frontend which the rest of the code was based on, and continued to make tweaks throughout to mature it.
    - I helped with the implementation of the cursor logic on the backend to make it controllable via the Kinect sensor.
